        <h2>Dark Lyrics</h2>
        <p>There goes my heart beating</p>
        <p> 'Cause you are the reason</p>
        <p> I'm losing my sleep</p>
        <p> Please come back now</p>
        <p>And there goes my mind racing</p>
        <p>  And you are the reason</p>
        <p>  That I'm still breathing</p>
        <p> I'm hopeless now</p>
        <p>I'd climb every mountain</p>
        <p>   And swim every ocean</p>
        <p> Just to be with you</p>
        <p> And fix what I've broken</p>
        <p> Oh, 'cause I need you to see</p>
        <p>That you are the reason</p>
        <p>There goes my hands shaking</p>
        <p> And you are the reason</p>
        <p> My heart keeps bleeding</p>
        <p> I need you now</p>
        <p>And if I could turn back the clock</p>
        <p> I'd make sure the light defeated the dark</p>
        <p> I'd spend every hour, of every day</p>
        <p> Keeping you safe</p>
        <p>And I'd climb every mountain</p>
        <p> And swim every ocean</p>
        <p> Just to be with you</p>
        <p> And fix what I've broken</p>
        <p> Oh, 'cause I need you to see</p>
        <p>  That you are the reason</p>
